# k8s/swarm test drive

Testing both.

## Prerequisites

You need a working AWS account with admin power to run this scripts.

## Usage

The first time you run the script you need to download the archive:

    ./00-setup.sh false

Once you have download the archive the first time just run:

    ./00-setup.sh

## Notes

I download the script get_k8s.io from github latest since the version online
today does not allow me to install version 1.3 of k8s. Also I needed the new
flags.
